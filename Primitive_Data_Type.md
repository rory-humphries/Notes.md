title: Primitive Data Type

# Definition

> In computer science, primitive data types are a set of basic data types from which all other data types are constructed. Specifically it often refers to the limited set of data representations in use by a particular processor, which all compiled programs must use. Most processors support a similar set of primitive data types, although the specific representations vary. More generally, "primitive data types" may refer to the standard data types built into a programming language. Data types which are not primitive are referred to as derived or composite.

> Primitive types are almost always value types, but composite types may also be value types.

For example, `int`, `char`, and `float` are primitive types in the `C` (and many other) language.
