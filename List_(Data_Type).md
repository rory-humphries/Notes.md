# Definition

The [abstract data type](Abstract_Data_Type.md), List, is a finite ordered sequence of values.

# Implementations

A list is often implemented by the following data structures:

- [Array](Array.md)
- [Linked_List](Linked_List.md)

> In computer science, a **list** or sequence is an abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once. An instance of a list is a computer representation of the mathematical concept of a tuple or finite sequence; the (potentially) infinite analog of a list is a stream. Lists are a basic example of containers, as they contain other values. If the same value occurs multiple times, each occurrence is considered a distinct item.

> The name **list** is also used for several concrete data structures that can be used to implement abstract lists, especially linked lists and arrays. In some contexts, such as in Lisp programming, the term list may refer specifically to a linked list rather than an array. In class-based programming, lists are usually provided as instances of sub-classes of a generic "list" class, and traversed via separate iterators.
