# Definition

> A heap is a specialised [tree](Tree_(Data_Type).md)-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete tree that satisfies the heap property:
>
> - in a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C.
> - In a min heap, the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C. The node at the "top" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.

# Implementation

> Heaps are usually implemented with an array, as follows:
>
> - Each element in the array represents a node of the heap, and
> - The parent / child relationship is defined implicitly by the elements' indices in the array.
