# Definition

> In computer science, a data structure is a data organisation, management, and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data.
>
> Data structures serve as the basis for [abstract data types](Abstract_Data_Type.md) (ADT). The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type.
