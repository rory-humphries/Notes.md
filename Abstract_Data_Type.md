# Definition

> In computer science, an **abstract data type** (**ADT**) is a mathematical model for data types. An abstract data type is defined by its behaviour  from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behaviour of these operations. This mathematical model contrasts with [data structures](Data_Structure.md), which are concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer, not a user.

# Common Abstract Data Types

Most ADT's are a variation of one of the below:

## Linear

- [List](List_(Data_Type).md)
- [Priority_Queue](Priority_Queue.md)
- [Stack](Stack.md)
- [Queue](Queue.md)

## Non-Linear

- [Associative_Array](Associative_Array.md)
- [Graph](Graph_(Data_Type).md)
- [Tree](Tree_(Data_Type).md)
